          <p class='text-xxs'>The Lesser HTTP Refactor Aside from the normal answering of queries and issues, February has been a month dominated by the difference between the asio::DynamicBuffer_v1 and asio::DynamicBuffer_v2 concepts. As I understand things, both Beast and Asio libraries developed the idea of the DynamicBuffer concept (or more correctly, Named Type Requirement [NTR]) at roughly the same time, but with slightly different needs. The original Asio DyanmicBuffer describes a move-only type, designed to be a short-lived wrapper over storage which would allow a composed operation to easily manage data insertions or retrievals from that storage through models of the MutableBufferSequence and ConstBufferSequence NTRs. In Beast, it was found that DynamicBuffer objects being move-only caused a difficultly, because the necessarily complex composed operations in Beast need to create a DynamicBuffer, perform operations on it, pass it to a sub-operation for further manipulation and then continue performing operations on the same buffer. If the DynamicBuffer as been passed by move to a sub operation, then before the buffer can be used again, it will have to be moved back to the caller by the callee. Rather than complicate algorithms, Beast’s authors took a slightly different track - Beast DynamicBuffers were specified to be pass-by-reference....</p>

          <p class='text-xxs'>History This is my first entry on the C++ Alliance web site. I’m very happy to say that I was invited to join the organisation at the end of December last year. I first met Vinnie on Slack when I chose to use Boost.Beast in a greenfield project - a highly scalable market data distribution system and quoting gateway for the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange liquid.com. There were a number of candidates for C++ HTTP frameworks and it is interesting for me to examine the decision-making process I went through in choosing one. If I am honest, there are two main factors that influenced me towards Boost.Beast: I am a long-time fanboi of Boost.Asio. I find it’s paradigm very pleasing. Once you decipher the (extremely terse!) documentation it becomes obvious that it was written by a hyper-intelligent extraterrestrial masquerading as a human being. I have used the Boost Library (or more correctly, libraries) for many years. Boost has become synonymous with trust, quality and dependability. As far as I have always been concerned, boost is the standard. The standard library has always been a pale shadow of it. When I started the new project there was an expectation that I would...</p>

          <p class='text-xxs'>There are four main areas where I spend my time. Libc++, where I am the “code owner” WG21, where I am the chair of the Library Working Group (LWG) Boost Speaking at conferences Lots of work these month(s) behind the scenes, getting stuff ready for C++20, LLVM 9, and Boost 1.71.0. Libc++ The LLVM 9.0 release has shipped! The release date was 19-September, a few days later than planned. There are a lot of new libc++ features in the release. As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day. Many times, bug reports are based on misunderstandings, but require a couple of hours of work in order to figure out where the misunderstanding lies. We’re working on a major redesign of the “debug mode” for libc++, after we realized that the existing (not widely used) debug mode is useless when you’re trying to do things at compile (constexpr) time. I have been spending a lot of time the last few weeks working on the calendaring stuff in &lt;chrono&gt;, specifically the interface with the...</p>
