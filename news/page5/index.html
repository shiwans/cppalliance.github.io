          <p class='text-xxs'>Boost.Beast I’ve started working on improvements to the zlib part of Beast. There are some gaps in the test harness of these components, so I’ve decided to increase coverage. As a first step, I started porting test cases from the original zlib library’s tests, to verify that existing code matches the expected behavior of the original library. Fortunately, I’ve not found any significant discrepancies, there’s only one issue where Beast rejects malformed input for the wrong reason (I’m still looking into it whether it’s actually an issue at the time of writing this). I’ve also looked into providing more meaningful feedback from test failures in Beast, especially when they’re run in CI. While the current test framework does print a line number on failure, the line number is often in a function template that’s called by multiple test cases, which makes it quite hard to determine which test failed just from the log, often requiring the use of a debugger. Doing that locally may not be a problem, but it’s significantly harder in CI, so I’ve decided to try to use Boost Stacktrace to provide a callstack on each failure in Beast tests. Additionally, I’ve also worked on running the...</p>

Libc++, where I am the “code owner” WG21, where I am the chair of the Library Working Group (LWG) Boost Speaking at conferences This month, the big news (and the big work item) was the approval of the C++ “Committee Draft” at the WG21 meeting in Cologne on July 15-20. You can think of this as a “beta version” of the C++20 standard; all features are complete. The next step is bug fixing, with an eye towards releasing next year. Libc++ The LLVM 9.0 release is on track for September. We have a release branch, and the RC1 was recently dropped. Because of the run-up and the aftermath of the Cologne meeting, the libc++ accomplishments are a bit sparse this month. As the “code owner” for libc++, I also have to review the contributions of other people to libc++, and evaluate and fix bugs that are reported. That’s a never-ending task; there are new contributions ever day.

          <p class='text-xxs'>This month I’ve been working on the following projects: Certify Boost.Beast Certify After quite a bit of work exploring ways to make certificate verification more complete, I’ve concluded that Boost is currently missing a few tools to make that viable. A comprehensive solution requires, at the very least, a functional HTTP client able to handle higher-level semantics like redirects, proxies or compressed bodies. While these are unlikely to happen while performing an OCSP query or downloading a CRL set from Google’s update service, they still need to be handled, otherwise the user will be left in a no better state than when no library is used. At this point, Certify only offers basic verification, but that is still simillar level to what cURL does. Providing a comprehensive solution will require either a infrastructure solution (something like Google’s CRLsets) or a library based one (i.e. build up all the required libraries to be able to perform proper certificate status checks). Boost.Beast I’ve continued the work on expanding split compilation in Beast, by turning some internal function templates, in websocket code, into regular functions. Additionally, I’ve simplified the websocket prng code after proving with some benchmarks that the previous solution made it...</p>

          <p class='text-xxs'>This month I’ve been working on the following projects: Certify Boost.Beast Boost.Build Certify This month, I’ve worked on expanding the documentation of Certify, especially the example and introduction parts. When looking through the documentation for Boost.Build I found out it’s possible to import snippets from *.cpp files into the documentation, which will allow me to make sure that snippets in the documentation compile and are tested. I’ve also attempted cleaning up the Certify build script to use the OpenSSL module in b2, but I ran into issues, so I’ll have get back to this one in the future. Don’t forget to star the repository: https://github.com/djarek/certify! Boost.Beast I’ve been able to complete the port of the Beast CI to Azure Pipelines and expand the test matrix beyond what was tested in the existing CI infrastructure. Thanks to the expanded concurrent job limit, a full run on AzP takes less time than a full Travis and Appveyor build, especially when wait times are taken into accout. One of the matrix items I added were tests for header-only no-deprecated builds, which turned out to be broken. Untested code has a nasty tendency to rot. I’ve also been able to identify some function templates...</p>
